One-time: enable run.sh / TRIGGER_DEPLOY.sh to trigger deploy without opening Render.

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com → bills.battleship → webpoint-dep-highlighter → Settings.
2. Find "Deploy Hook" → copy the URL (https://api.render.com/deploy/srv-...?key=...).
3. Run in Terminal:
   echo 'RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL=paste_url_here' >> "/Users/billmccreary/Desktop/Webpoint_ Workspace/Toolbox/deploy/.env"
4. After that, run.sh or TRIGGER_DEPLOY.sh will trigger deploy. No Manual Deploy needed.
