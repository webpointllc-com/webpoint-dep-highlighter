WE ARE NOT POSTED YET. DO THIS:

1. BROWSER (I opened it for you)
   - If the GitHub "New repository" page opened:
     • Owner: webpointilc-com
     • Repository name: webpoint-dep-highlighter (should be filled)
     • Description (optional): DEP Highlighter – Webpoint Toolbox. Clone Excel, highlight duplicate DEP parcels, preserve VBA/macros. Deploy to Railway/Render.
     • Leave "Add a README" UNCHECKED
     • Click the green "Create repository" button

2. TERMINAL (push the code)
   - Open Terminal (Cmd+Space, type Terminal, Enter)
   - Copy and paste this whole block, then press Enter:

cd "/Users/billmccreary/Desktop/Webpoint_ Workspace/Toolbox/deploy"
git push -u origin main

   - If it asks for login: use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (not your password). Or run first: gh auth login (approve in browser), then git push again.

3. DONE
   - When push succeeds, we're posted. Then: Railway → deploy from this repo → get URL → I'll give you the HTML for SquareSpace + clipboard.
