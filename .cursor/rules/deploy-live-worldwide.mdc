# Deploy live worldwide

- **Default:** Changes to this repo are pushed to `origin main` and deployed to production. No local-only by default.
- **Permission:** Full permission to push, trigger deploy, and make changes live on the public web (Render, webpointllc.com).
- **Flow:** After editing DEP Highlighter server, static files, or config: commit, push to `origin main`. If GitHub Actions has `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` set, deploy runs automatically; otherwise run `./TRIGGER_DEPLOY.sh` (with deploy hook in `.env`) or trigger Manual Deploy on Render.
- **Worldwide:** The live app is https://webpoint-dep-highlighter.onrender.com and https://webpointllc.com/webpoint-toolbox. Treat these as the real targets; local run is for testing only.
